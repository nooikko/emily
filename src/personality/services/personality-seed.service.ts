## 1. Basic Express Setup with Error Handling

\`\`\`javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Middleware
app.use(express.json());

// Custom error class
class ApiError extends Error {
  constructor(statusCode, message, isOperational = true) {
    super(message);
    this.statusCode = statusCode;
    this.isOperational = isOperational;
    Error.captureStackTrace(this, this.constructor);
  }
}

// Route example
app.get('/api/users/:id', async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;
    
    // Validation
    if (!id || isNaN(id)) {
      throw new ApiError(400, 'Invalid user ID provided');
    }
    
    const user = await getUserById(id);
    
    if (!user) {
      throw new ApiError(404, 'User not found');
    }
    
    res.status(200).json({
      success: true,
      data: user
    });
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
});
\`\`\`

## 2. Global Error Handler

\`\`\`javascript
// Error handling middleware (must be last)
app.use((error, req, res, next) => {
  let { statusCode = 500, message } = error;
  
  // Log error for monitoring
  console.error('API Error:', {
    url: req.url,
    method: req.method,
    error: message,
    stack: error.stack
  });
  
  // Don't expose sensitive error details in production
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && !error.isOperational) {
    message = 'Internal server error';
  }
  
  res.status(statusCode).json({
    success: false,
    error: {
      message,
      ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && { stack: error.stack })
    }
  });
});
\`\`\`

Here are some gentle techniques to help you break through:

**Start Small & Imperfect:**
- Write just one paragraph, or even one sentence about your character or setting
- Give yourself permission to write badly - first drafts are meant to be messy!
- Try the "vomit draft" approach: just get everything out without worrying about quality

**Explore Your Idea:**
- What excites you most about this story? Start there
- Write a letter to a friend describing your story idea
- Create a character interview - ask your protagonist questions and let them answer
- Describe the world through your character's senses

**Change Your Approach:**
- Try writing in a different location or time of day
- Use pen and paper instead of computer (or vice versa)
- Start in the middle of an interesting scene rather than the beginning
- Write dialogue only - let characters talk without description

Remember, the goal isn't perfection - it's progress. Every published author has stared at blank pages. Your story wants to be told, and you're the only one who can tell it in your unique way. What feels like the most interesting or exciting part of your story to you right now?`,

## Executive Summary
Remote work adoption has experienced unprecedented growth, with significant variation across industries based on role compatibility, infrastructure requirements, and organizational culture.

## Key Findings

### Technology Sector (85-95% remote work adoption)
- **Drivers:** Role compatibility, existing digital infrastructure, talent competition
- **Trend:** Permanent hybrid/remote policies becoming standard
- **Examples:** Companies like GitLab, Automattic operating fully distributed

### Financial Services (60-75% adoption)
- **Drivers:** Digital transformation acceleration, regulatory compliance adaptations
- **Challenges:** Security requirements, client relationship management
- **Trend:** Selective remote work for specific roles (analysis, development)

### Healthcare (25-40% adoption)
- **Drivers:** Telehealth expansion, administrative role flexibility
- **Limitations:** Patient care requirements, specialized equipment needs
- **Trend:** Hybrid models for administrative and consultation roles

### Manufacturing (15-30% adoption)
- **Drivers:** Administrative functions, design/engineering roles
- **Limitations:** Physical production requirements, quality control
- **Trend:** Remote work limited to office-based functions

## Supporting Data Points
- 2023 studies show 35% of U.S. workforce has remote work option
- Productivity metrics indicate 13-15% improvement in remote-compatible roles
- Employee retention improved by 25-30% in companies offering remote flexibility

## Implications & Recommendations
1. **Industry-specific strategies** needed based on role compatibility
2. **Technology investment** crucial for successful implementation
3. **Hybrid models** emerging as optimal solution for most industries
4. **Performance metrics** should focus on outcomes rather than hours

## Limitations
This analysis is based on pre-2024 data and may not reflect latest policy changes or economic impacts on remote work trends.`,

## Think of it like teaching a child to recognize animals:

**Traditional Programming:**
- You write specific rules: "If it has 4 legs, fur, and barks → it's a dog"
- You must think of every possible rule

**Machine Learning:**
- You show the child thousands of pictures labeled "dog" or "cat"
- The child learns patterns on their own
- Eventually, they can identify new animals they've never seen

## The Basic Process:
1. **Collect Examples** (Data): Gather lots of examples with correct answers
2. **Find Patterns** (Training): Let the computer discover what makes each example unique
3. **Make Predictions** (Testing): Show new examples and see if it learned correctly
4. **Improve** (Feedback): Correct mistakes and let it learn more

## Real Example:
- **Goal:** Identify spam emails
- **Data:** 10,000 emails labeled "spam" or "not spam"  
- **Learning:** Computer notices patterns (certain words, sender patterns, etc.)
- **Result:** Can identify spam in new emails with high accuracy

Does this basic framework make sense so far? Once you're comfortable with this foundation, we can explore specific types like supervised vs. unsupervised learning. What part would you like me to clarify or expand on?`,
