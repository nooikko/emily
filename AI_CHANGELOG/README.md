# AI_CHANGELOG

This directory contains the official record of completed work as validated by all agents.

## Purpose

The AI_CHANGELOG serves as institutional memory for the agent team, documenting:
- Successfully completed implementations
- Key decisions and trade-offs made
- Patterns established for future reference
- Lessons learned and gotchas discovered

## Process

1. **code-validation-auditor** confirms all requirements are met
2. **project-coordinator** creates a changelog entry
3. Entry includes contributions from all participating agents

## File Format

Files follow the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`

Each entry contains:
- Date and task description
- What was implemented/changed
- Which agents participated
- Key decisions made
- Any gotchas or learnings
- Links to relevant AI_RESEARCH documents

## Usage

- Review before starting similar tasks
- Reference established patterns
- Learn from past challenges and solutions
- Maintain consistency across implementations

## Important

Entries are created ONLY after full validation. This is the source of truth for completed work.
