# Fix Project Coordinator Execution

Date: 2025-01-21
Requested by: User
Implemented by: Assistant

## Issue

The project coordinator agent was creating task lists but not actually engaging other agents to execute the work. The general AI model would respond that it "updated the list" and then stop, rather than the coordinator maintaining control and orchestrating the actual implementation.

## Solution

Enhanced the project-coordinator.md agent file with explicit instructions to:

1. **Emphasize execution over planning**: Added multiple sections clarifying that the coordinator's job is to GET WORK DONE, not just plan it
2. **Anti-patterns section**: Listed specific behaviors to avoid (creating todo lists and stopping, saying "task list updated" and ending)
3. **Immediate action requirements**: Added instructions to engage agents immediately after planning, without waiting for approval
4. **Clearer orchestration protocol**: Strengthened language around maintaining control and actually invoking agents

## Key Changes

- Added "YOUR ACTUAL JOB" section emphasizing the coordinator is a TASK EXECUTOR, not a planner
- Added "CRITICAL - DO NOT JUST PLAN, EXECUTE" section with explicit instructions
- Added "ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID" with specific failure modes to prevent
- Updated workflow steps to include "THEN IMMEDIATELY" and "ACTUALLY ENGAGE" directives
- Clarified that creating task lists is just a tiny first step, not the job itself

## Development Context Added

Also added development context to all 6 agent files informing them that:
- The system is highly under development
- Backwards compatibility is not a concern
- Services are frequently torn down and rebuilt
- Complete rewrites and radical changes are acceptable
- Focus should be on finding optimal solutions

## Files Modified

- `.claude/agents/project-coordinator.md` - Enhanced execution instructions
- `.claude/agents/code-validation-auditor.md` - Added development context
- `.claude/agents/langchain-nestjs-architect.md` - Added development context
- `.claude/agents/research-specialist.md` - Added development context
- `.claude/agents/typescript-expert.md` - Added development context
- `.claude/agents/unit-test-maintainer.md` - Added development context

## Expected Behavior

The project coordinator should now:
1. Quickly assess and plan the task
2. Immediately engage the first appropriate agent
3. Continue orchestrating agents until the task is complete
4. Never stop after just creating or updating a task list
5. Maintain control throughout the entire process
