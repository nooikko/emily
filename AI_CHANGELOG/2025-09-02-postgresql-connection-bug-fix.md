# PostgreSQL Connection Bug Fix - 2025-09-02

## Summary
Fixed critical PostgreSQL connection error in agent.service.ts that was preventing the application from starting properly due to incorrect SQL column reference syntax.

## Problem
The application was failing to start with PostgreSQL connection errors. The root cause was in `src/api/agent/service/agent/agent.service.ts` where the SQL query was using invalid column reference syntax:
- **Incorrect**: `conversations.id AS conversations.id` 
- **Correct**: `conversations.id AS "conversations.id"`

PostgreSQL requires double quotes around column aliases that contain dots or special characters.

## Solution Implemented
- **Agent Coordination**: @project-coordinator orchestrated the fix
- **Implementation**: @typescript-expert corrected the SQL syntax in agent.service.ts
- **Testing**: @unit-test-maintainer verified all tests pass and no regressions
- **Final Validation**: @code-validation-auditor confirmed the fix resolves the issue

## Technical Details
**File Changed**: `src/api/agent/service/agent/agent.service.ts`
**Line**: SQL query in findConversationsByUserId method
**Change**: Added proper double quotes around column alias containing dots

**Before**:
```typescript
conversations.id AS conversations.id
```

**After**:
```typescript
conversations.id AS "conversations.id"
```

## Validation Results
- âœ… Application builds successfully
- âœ… Application starts without errors
- âœ… Database connection works correctly
- âœ… All existing tests pass
- âœ… No regressions introduced
- âœ… Follows PostgreSQL SQL standards

## Impact
- **Immediate**: Application now starts successfully
- **Stability**: Eliminates PostgreSQL connection failures
- **Development**: Developers can run the application locally without issues

## Lessons Learned
- PostgreSQL has strict requirements for column alias syntax
- Column aliases containing dots must be quoted with double quotes
- Quick targeted fixes are often more effective than broad refactoring
